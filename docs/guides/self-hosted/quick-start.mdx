# Notes

- To start automatically all containers with `docker compose up -d`, comment out the `profiles: [building]` lines in `docker-compose.yml`

- You may possibly need to comment out the lines specifying `platforms: - 'linux/amd64'` in `docker-compose.yml`

- To run migrations from inside the docker containers after they are started with `docker compose up -d`, use the following command:
  `docker exec -it -e CI=1 -w /app/apps/gateway/node_modules/@latitude-data/core latitude-llm-gateway-1 /usr/local/lib/node_modules/corepack/shims/pnpm db:migrate`
